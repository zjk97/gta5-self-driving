# Final Project for CS1470 Deep Learning

## Team
 * Yipu Gao

## Training Data
 * Training data are too large for git. We have saved them on Google Drive.
 * Data collected manually from GTA5 custom race
 * Settings: Noon, bright, no traffic, no pedestrians
 * Vehicle: BMX bike (duh!)

## Notes
 * This project was developed on Windows, install dependencies and execute main.py from Command Prompt instead of a linux based terminal
